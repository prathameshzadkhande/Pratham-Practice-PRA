Problem Statement
Employee Performance Analysis
You are given information about different departments of a company. Each department has multiple employees, and each employee has a performance rating.

You need to:
Find unique ratings given by employees of a specific department.
Find department names whose average employee rating is greater than a given threshold.

Input Format
First line: An integer r — number of departments.
For each department:
An integer — Department ID.
A string — Department Name.
An integer — Number of employees in the department.
For each employee:
A string — Employee Name.
A double — Employee Rating.

After all department details:
An integer — Department ID to find unique ratings.
A double — Threshold rating to find departments with average rating above it.

Constraints
1 <= r <= 100
1 <= Department ID <= 1000
1 <= Department Name length <= 100
1 <= Number of employees <= 100
1 <= Employee Name length <= 100
0.0 <= Rating <= 5.0

Output Format
First, print the unique ratings (each on a new line) for the given Department ID in any order.
If the Department ID is not found, print "Department Not Found".
Then, print the department names where the average rating is greater than the given threshold (each on a new line).
If no such department is found, print "No Department Found with Above threshold".

Sample Input:

2
101
Software
3
Alice
4.2
Bob
3.8
Charlie
4.5
102
Marketing
2
David
3.5
Eve
3.9
101
4.0

Sample Output:

4.2
3.8
4.5
Software

Explanation
For Department ID 101, the ratings are 4.2, 3.8, and 4.5 (unique values).
Department "Software" has an average rating of (4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5) / 3 = 4.1666..., which is greater than the threshold 4.0, so "Software" is printed.

Notes
You should create two classes:
Company to store department details.
Performance to store employee details.
Use collections like HashSet and ArrayList appropriately.
Carefully handle the case when no department matches the given Department ID or threshold condition.
