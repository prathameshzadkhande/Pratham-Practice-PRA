Employee Department Rating Analysis
Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a system to manage employee performance ratings across different departments in a company.

Each Company department has:
A department ID
A department name
A list of employees with their performance ratings.

Your tasks are:
Implement a method to find the unique ratings of employees belonging to a specific department (by department ID).
Implement a method to find the names of departments whose average employee rating is strictly greater than a given threshold.
Classes Provided
Company
Performance
You must read all input inside the main method of the Employee class.

Input Format
First line: An integer r — number of departments.
Next r blocks, for each department:
An integer — Department ID.
A string — Department Name.
An integer — Number of employees.

For each employee:
A string — Employee Name.
A double — Employee Rating.
After reading all departments:
An integer — Department ID to search unique ratings.
A double — Rating threshold.

Constraints
1 <= r <= 100
1 <= Department ID <= 1000
1 <= Department Name length <= 100
1 <= Number of employees <= 100
1 <= Employee Name length <= 100
0 <= Rating <= 5.0

Output Format
First, print the unique employee ratings (one rating per line) for the department with the given ID.
If the department is not found, print "Deparment Not Found".
Then, print the names of departments whose average employee rating is strictly greater than the given threshold (one name per line).
If no such department is found, print "No Department Found with Above threshold".

Sample Input :

Alice

Bob
3.2
Charlie

102
HR
2
David
4.0
Eva
3.8
101
4.0

Sample Output:
3.2
4.5
IT

Explanation
Department ID 101 corresponds to "IT" with employees rated 4.5, 3.2, and 4.5.
Unique ratings are {3.2, 4.5}.
IT" department's average rating is (4.5 + 3.2 + 4.5)/3 = 4.066..., which is greater than 4.0.
Hence, "IT" is printed.

Note
If multiple ratings or department names are printed, they can appear in any order.
If no department or ratings are found according to the criteria, the appropriate error messages must be printed as mentioned.
