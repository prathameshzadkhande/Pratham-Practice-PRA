Problem Statement:

Performance Analysis of Departments

In a company, there are multiple departments, and each department has employees with performance ratings. The management wants to analyze department-wise ratings based on the following requirements:

Find all unique performance ratings for a given department.

Identify departments whose average employee rating exceeds a given threshold.

Your task is to implement a program that processes department details, employee performance ratings, and then performs the above queries.
Input Format:

The first line contains an integer N representing the number of departments.

The next N blocks contain department details:

An integer D_id representing the department ID.

A string D_name representing the department name.

An integer E representing the number of employees in that department.

The next E lines contain:

A string E_name representing the employee name.

A double rating representing the employee's performance rating.

An integer D_query representing a department ID for which unique ratings need to be fetched.

A double threshold representing the average rating threshold to find departments that exceed this rating.

Output Format:

If department D_query exists, print all unique ratings for that department in separate lines.

If the department does not exist, print "Department Not Found".

If any department has an average rating greater than threshold, print their department names in separate lines.

If no department satisfies this condition, print "No Department Found with Above Threshold".
